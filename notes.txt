The Imperiphor: 
Roughly twice the size of a bear, the Imperiphor is a menace to any warrior who fights from a medium or long distance, due to the difficulty of penetrating its scaly, metallic exterior. It is believed to be native to Staten Island, and insists, to anyone who will listen, that its homeland is the most important part of New York City. 
The Cambrilevar: 
The Cambrilevar has the unique ability to transform itself from any form into an arrow, its preferred form. As an arrow, it can achieve speeds above the speed of sound, allowing it to attack those around it in a terrifying and seemingly random fashion, but at great risk to itself.
The Salvisanguin: 
Resembling a vermillion penguin, the Salvisanguin heals itself after being wounded by concentrating its life force to a special place inside of it, then circulating parts of it in the areas of its wounds. Because its favorite food is fish, its presence can generally be smelled by those around it.
