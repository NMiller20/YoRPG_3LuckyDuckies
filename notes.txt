 time spent: 7 hrs

 DISCO:
 * Having a try...catch... block is good standard convention for accounting for errors in user input
 * extends - copies the functionality of the parent class into the subclass
 * versus creating an instance of the class
 * You can check not just an arithmetic expression but also for an instance of a class
 * Default constructors can be used to initialize instance vars
 * private Monster smaug stores an instance of a class as an object
 * You don't need to call on a toString method to override an object's memory address
 * toString method must be created in the Monster class because it's a super class of smaug


 QCC:
 * What functionality does java.io and java.util each provide?
 * When would you employ try...catch... blocks?
 * What does IOException do? What happens after an exception is caught?

 OUR DRIVER MODS:
   * Players can now choose a protagonist subclass to play as
   * Implemented a RNG function so that all three monster subclasses have equal chance of being encountered.
   * Before choosing a Protagonist subclass, players have the option to view about descriptions for all Protagonist subclasses.
   * Added about descriptions so that they print out all atk/def/hp/etc. stats along wtih description too
   * Added safeguard measures so that when users choose difficulty >3 or try to choose a Protagonist subclass unavailable, users are prompted to input an input that is valid.
   * Protagonists have the new option to dodge, taking 0 damage and dealing 0 damage, but they lose 10 health every time they dodge for being a coward.
   * Monsters now have a 1 out of 3 chance of unlocking a brief powerup, where their damage is multiplied by 3. You can test your luck by seeing if you can dodge a powerup attack.
   * Monsters now have passives. Salvisanguins heal, Imperiphors increase defense, and Cambrilevars "self destruct" after each round.
   * Protagonists and Monsters have a 1/10 chance of naturally dodging attacks!

 Notes go here...


 The Imperiphor:
 Roughly twice the size of a bear, the Imperiphor is a menace to any warrior who fights from a medium or long distance, due to the difficulty of penetrating its scaly, metallic exterior. It is believed to be native to Staten Island, and insists, to anyone who will listen, that its homeland is the most important part of New York City.
 The Cambrilevar:
 The Cambrilevar has the unique ability to transform itself from any form into an arrow, its preferred form. As an arrow, it can achieve speeds above the speed of sound, allowing it to attack those around it in a terrifying and seemingly random fashion, but at great risk to itself.
 The Salvisanguin:
 Resembling a vermillion penguin, the Salvisanguin heals itself after being wounded by concentrating its life force to a special place inside of it, then circulating parts of it in the areas of its wounds. Because its favorite food is fish, its presence can generally be smelled by those around it.


 (Imperiphor = good at defense; ok at attack
 Cambrilevar = good at attack; really bad at defense and mediocre in terms of health
 Salvisanguin = has some mechanism to replenish health)
